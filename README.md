# tek12-fatjs demo

A simple to-do app built with [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/), syncing with a backend using [Slim](http://www.slimframework.com/) and MongoDB

## Requirements

* A web browser
* A web server (tested with Apache)
* PHP 5.3+
* MongoDB 2.0+

* you should serve this from a *root* URL, like `http://tek12-fatjs/`. The API routes assume that
* MongoDB should just be running on localhost
* Use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to install the PHP libs. The API app uses [Slim](http://www.slimframework.com/).
